# Technical Assessment (Compass 1) - Answer Key & Explanations

## Digital Signals

### Q-20. Why is it necessary to band-limit digital signals before modulation?

-   a)  To make the modulation process easier.\

-   b)  To limit the number of harmonics so as to save the spectrum
        occupancy.\

-   c)  To improve the inter-symbol interference by limiting the
        bandwidth of the signal.\

-   d)  To improve the bit error rate and noise performance.

**✅ Answer: b) To limit the number of harmonics so as to save the
spectrum occupancy.**\
**Explanation:** Band-limiting reduces harmonics, saves bandwidth, and
avoids interference.

## Components at RF

### Q-21. The skin effect on a conductor is an important consideration when the operating frequency is high. This is because:

-   a)  It shifts the operating frequency.\

-   b)  It increases the impedance of the conductor.\

-   c)  It increases the inductance of the conductor.\

-   d)  It reduces the electrical length of the conductor.

**✅ Answer: b) It increases the impedance of the conductor.**\
**Explanation:** At high frequency, current flows only on the surface →
effective resistance increases → impedance increases.

## Measurement Units

### Q-22. What is the gain in decibel when the power of a signal is doubled?

-   a)  1 dB\

-   b)  2 dB\

-   c)  3 dB\

-   d)  4 dB

**✅ Answer: c) 3 dB**\
**Explanation:** Doubling power = 10 log10(2) ≈ 3.01 dB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q-23. An amplifier has a power gain of 25 dB. If the gain is reduced by 100 times, what is the new gain in dB?

-   a)  5 dB\

-   b)  0.25 dB\

-   c)  0 dB\

-   d)  -75 dB

**✅ Answer: a) 5 dB**\
**Explanation:** 25 dB - 20 dB = 5 dB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Noise Concept

### Q-24. What is the value of noise figure for an ideal amplifier?

-   a)  0 dB\

-   b)  1 dB\

-   c)  -1 dB\

-   d)  Infinite

**✅ Answer: a) 0 dB**\
**Explanation:** Ideal amplifier adds no noise → NF = 0 dB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Multiple Access

### Q-36. Which of the following statements best describes the advantages of FDMA over CDMA?

-   a)  Not affected by near-far problem\

-   b)  Not affected by timing control for synchronization\

-   c)  Both of the above\

-   d)  None of the above

**✅ Answer: c) Both of the above**\
**Explanation:** FDMA avoids near-far problem and does not require
timing synchronization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q-37. Which of the following is not correct when a phone call is made via CDMA access scheme?

-   a)  CDMA transmission does not work by allocating channels for each
        phone call.\

-   b)  CDMA utilizes the entire spectrum for transmission of each
        call.\

-   c)  CDMA phone call is uniquely encoded and transmitted across the
        entire spectrum.\

-   d)  CDMA transmission allocates different carrier for each phone
        call.

**✅ Answer: d) CDMA transmission allocates different carrier for each
phone call.**\
**Explanation:** CDMA uses codes, not separate carriers, for each user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Antenna

### Q-38. What is the electrical wavelength of a 500 MHz signal?

-   a)  60 cm\

-   b)  6 m\

-   c)  0.06 m\

-   d)  60 m

**✅ Answer: a) 60 cm**\
**Explanation:** λ = c/f = 3×10\^8 / 5×10\^8 = 0.6 m = 60 cm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q-39. What is the polarization of a 1/2-wavelength antenna when it is perpendicular to the surface of the earth?

-   a)  Circular\

-   b)  Horizontal\

-   c)  Elliptical\

-   d)  Vertical

**✅ Answer: d) Vertical**\
**Explanation:** A half-wave or monopole antenna placed vertically
radiates vertically polarized waves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q-40. The resonant frequency of a monopole whip antenna can be increased by

-   a)  Decreasing the feed line impedance.\

-   b)  Increasing the feed line impedance.\

-   c)  Shortening the antenna.\

-   d)  Lengthening the antenna.

**✅ Answer: c) Shortening the antenna**\
**Explanation:** Shorter antenna → shorter wavelength → higher resonant
frequency.
